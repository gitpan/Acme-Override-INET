    WARNING: This may break your system

DESCRIPTION
    Installing this distribution replaces your IO::Socket::INET with a
    patched version that uses IO::Socket::IP. Don't do this unless you are
    willing to accept the risk of doing so.

    Use this only to test how effective IO::Socket::IP is as a drop-in
    replacement.
